# some-code
this project is a origin module invented by the XunSun's group, another professor focus on NLP.
I take this module as a practice to get familiar with the pytorch and NLP models, including attention model, LSTM, RNN and gated CNN.
What's more, we also have rewrited serval parts of the module and adjusted parameters for better performance. We have tested
We are planning to submit this paper to coming ACL(if we can get a good result)
